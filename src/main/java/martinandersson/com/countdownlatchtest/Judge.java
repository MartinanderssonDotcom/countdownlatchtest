/**
 * <h1>About this class</h1>
 * 
 * <p>The judge is the one responsible for starting a <code>Marathon</code>. He create a
 * new thread for each runner. Not until he has spawned all the runners, is he allowed to
 * start the race.</p>
 * 
 * <p>What makes the judge particular interesting is that he accepts parameters that will
 * govern whether or not the judge, and/or the runners, spend time doing some other errand
 * before they are ready to really participate in the start of the race.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This class and all related types is a demonstration that the first example provided
 * in the JavaDoc of {@link CountDownLatch} is not sufficient to achieve a similar task.
 * The Oracle provided example can only guarantee that no threads start <i>prior</i> to the
 * start signal, but the possibility of threads <i>missing</i> the start signal all together
 * and not spending time waiting for the signal is still there. Obviously not what we would
 * want in a real life application doing a marathon!</p>
 * 
 * <p>See {@linkplain Marathon} for an in-depth walkthrough of the workflow.</p>
 * 
 * <h1>Results using author's machine with hard coded defaults</h1>
 * 
 * <p><u>The Oracle example</u> will only make it, that is, no runners/threads will miss their
 * start if we impose an admin thread/judge delay.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If we use <u>no delays</u>, we can see that threads begin missing the start signal if only
 * just a low ratio of them. That is not okay. Fact is that this should be the normal behavior of
 * any code not implemented otherwise and using a "larger" amount of threads. The application will
 * see that the main driver finishes creating new threads quite fast and then simply fires the start
 * signal. Yet the operating system hasn't had time enough to schedule all the workers.</p>
 * 
 * <p>If we on the other hand impose a worker thread/runner <u>delay</u>, <strong>all</strong> runners
 * will miss the start signal!<p>
 * 
 * <p>Using the solution made <strong>no</strong> threads miss their start, independently of the previously
 * described conditions.</p>
 *  
 * <h1>Do note that..</h1>
 * 
 * <p>..a real test with exact results is hard to write in a concurrent environment. For example,
 * there is room for cheating between when the judge has fired the starting pistol and when he actually
 * set the race started flag; this task is not "atomic". A runner thread "arriving" at the starting line
 * within this time frame would think that the race hasn't been started and thus fail to report it.
 * There are probably more room for improvements elsewhere too. This is all related to the <i>measurement</i>
 * of false starts and could be countered using synchronizing mechanisms. However, the provided solution, to
 * the best of my own understanding, has no restrictions and provides the right type of result we can at
 * best expect to see given other constraints such as OS thread scheduling and thread administration.</p>
